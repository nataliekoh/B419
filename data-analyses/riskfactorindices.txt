Use only these risk factors (indices) for analyses:

2007: 1-8, 20-23
2008: 1-8, 20-23
2009: 1-8, 20-23
2010: 1-10, 14-15, 19-23
2011: 1-8, 20-23
2012: 1-10, 12, 18, 20-23
2013: 1-8, 13-15, 18, 20-23

Data for risk factors 1-8 & 20-23 should be extracted across all years for comparison.

n.b. indices were extracted from preliminary plots in Prelim_Plots.m
