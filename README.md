## TB Risk Factor Analysis and Visualization
Natalie Koh and Vincent Wu

### Database(s):
[WHO](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home)<br>
Specific links are found in data/db_sources.json.

### Potential Questions:
From compiling together multiple WHO datasets, we will have TB risk factor-related data from K countries spanning a range of N years. Specifically, our question is to study how TB prevalence for any given country is affected by a set of risk factors. In addition to our data analysis approach, we hope to provide a global overview through a map-based visualization of this merged dataset of risk factors.
